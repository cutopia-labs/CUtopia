In addition, studies find that investors are committed to certain heuristic-based biases and frame dependent such as overconfidence, optimism, self-attribution, illusion of control, loss aversion, representativeness heuristic, anchoring, availability, ambiguity aversion, hindsight, flaming, etc. Behavioral biases combined with limits to arbitrage may result in securities not to be correctly priced.This course will help students understand how individuals\u2019 attitudes and behaviors affect their financial decisions and financial markets.
