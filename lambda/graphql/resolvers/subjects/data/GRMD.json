Theoretical exploration will help bring out ideas about space, place, power, cultural landscape, and identity. How people use space and develop it into place will be discussed. Many examples will be used to help students understand the approaches of cultural geography. \u00a0 1.

Now, student will begin their journey of understanding the subject matter, with a focus on several key cultural regions in China (see Section 4 for more details on the selection of these cultural regions). The aim of this component is to covey a deep sense of place as an integral system engaging multiple force, e.g. myth and legend, power and politics, history and tradition, religion and symbol, nature and geography, cultural practices, and society\u2019s interconnection with the environment. The task is to grasp the different approaches as distinct human-environment systems in cultural landscape formation. Moreover, students will make a good sense of a wide geographical variation of Chinese cultural values and practices. \u00a0 \u00a0 4.

In an era of globalization, the regional and national aspects of growth are continuously contested through both spatial (e.g. areas, their interactions and relationship with other areas) and aspatial (e.g. institutional and political factors) processes. This course will provide an overview of key economic-geographical theories and concepts in analyzing economic processes at various geographical scales. To this end, the relationships between space, economy and society will be discussed using a number of cases. Topics cover globalization and local development, and how they work together to shape spatial organization and economic change, location of production and transnational corporations, and spatial interaction and network.

This approach to development should not only generate economic growth, but also distribute its benefits equitably, regenerate the environment rather than destroy it, as well as empower people rather than marginalize them. The UN 2030 Agenda came into effect in 2015 promising to \u201cinterlink and integrate\u201d Sustainable Development Goals in an attempt to implement solutions facing humanity. Sustainable development goals are an all-inclusive invitation to act to end poverty, secure the planet and ensure that all people appreciate peace and prosperity.This course introduces the concept of sustainable development, the evolution of models and the implicit assumptions they make, as well as their contradictions. It also traces the advent of the SDGs and the extent that they support the principles of sustainable development. We examine the emergence of environmental problems and critically review the institutional responses to these problems since the late 1960s. We then consider in detail the increasingly popular idea of efforts in the pursuit of the SDGs from different perspectives that centres around people, planet, prosperity, peace and the partnerships involved in achieving the goals. The lectures will explore how achieving sustainable development goals will depends much on effective planning and good governance. Examples from different parts of the world will be used to underline the tight inter-connections between processes in different regions and across geographical scales in the context of sustainable development.

The concepts and principles of nature conservation will be addressed from a holistic point of view, followed by an investigation of nature conservation practices and their effect on the environment in Hong Kong. The latter shall include legislation, designation and management of the protected areas. Specifically, country, marine parks and geopark are developed to protected terrestrial and marine habitats as well as the associated wildlife, and geodiversity, respectively. Threats to protected areas and their mitigation for sustainability in Hong Kong will also be addressed alongside comparison with overseas experiences. The course does not teach students how to identify the different species of plants, birds, insects, corals or rocks. Instead, it provides a framework for students to look at nature conservation from the perspective of sustainable development, that is incorporating the economic, social, environmental and institutional dimensions of development.

In addition, this course also discusses the principles in evaluating the quality of a research. This course is organized into three modules. The first module introduces how a research topic and its relevant questions are set up, how to use the existing literature and various geographic theories to frame a research, and how to design fieldwork and sampling schemes. The second module introduces the qualitative methods in geographical research, such as conducting fieldwork, collecting and analyzing data, writing research findings, and dealing with ethical concerns.

Many geographic information system (GIS) related assignments are to produce maps, i.e. to present spatial data, process, and analytical results in form of map products. Cartographic knowledge and technique is a type of grammar that allows for the effective design and production of quality maps and other visual products. However, in recent decades, the process of map production is changing from supply to demand-driven and the function of maps emphasizes more on exploratory capability. Cartographers follow stipulated methods and techniques while incorporation of new ideas due to the emergent paradigm shift becomes equally important in map production. By adopting the five-step design thinking process, meaningful and innovative ideas can be generated in creating better maps for visual communication and exploration.This course introduces the principles of cartography and design thinking process. Fundamental concepts of cartography include map projection and conventional map design theories such as colour theory, symbolization and map design will be covered in the first part of the course. The design thinking process including empathize, define, ideate, prototype and test is introduced and practiced associated with a map-making problem that is going to be solved by students in group. This course is taught with lectures, laboratories and interactive class activities. Lectures are designed to cover important theoretical concepts while the laboratories are implemented to provide students hands-on experience and skills on cartographic presentation and visualization using several software tools.
