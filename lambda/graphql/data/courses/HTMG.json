Second, we will examine how people interact with one another and work in groups and teams. Topics range from team dynamics, group decision making, power and influence, to conflict management. Leadership theories and practices will also be discussed. Third, we will discuss how organizational-level factors such as organizational culture and change affect attitudes, behaviors, and work performances of employees. The OB concepts and theories are closely related to HRM. Through the course students will learn how to apply OB theories to improve HRM effectiveness in a variety of areas, e.g., job design and analysis, employee recruitment and selection, training and socialization, employee performance appraisal, compensation and benefits, and organizational culture formation and maintenance. Students will also learn what characteristics, behaviors, attitudes, and competencies define good leadership and how to ensure successful organizational changes through effectively motivating employees. Overall, this course explains why and how individuals and groups are motivated to do their jobs and helps students develop critical leadership skills to manage people and organizational changes.Blended-mode class section is available for this course.

High-speed rail has reshaped the travel market, promoted tourist destinations and re-defined the competition between air and rail.

On the most basic level a brand is still about a promise of consistency and a mark of value, but the role of branding is much more complex. Today, there is widespread recognition that brands are more than a logo that stimulates recognition and helps to identify a product or service. Instead we now appreciate that it is the emotional and intangible qualities that underpin the value of a brand. The hospitality sector has been quick to embrace \u201cbrand\u201d in this regard recognizing that these qualities offer the greatest means of competitive advantage. Thus, to not only succeed but to thrive in a competitive landscape, hotels and other service brands in the wider hospitality sector, need to stand out by \u201cstanding for\u201d something. There are now actual processes in place to achieve this. They require a position upon which to build the brand and its reputation, a brand strategy to tell and manage the brand\u2019s story and a business plan with strong competencies and capabilities that create value.

Students are required to learn not only the various ethical principles but also their implications in specific decision contexts.

It is closely related to real estate asset management, especially for the luxury brand flagship stores, and specialty retail brands like Ikea, for which locating land for its huge Blue Box Ikea stores is critical to its business success.This course examines different types of retailing, future trends in the retailing industry, and the key management skills required for this industry. In addition to retail operations and management practices, the course will also discuss the relations between the retailing industry and the tourism and real estate industries. The course also discusses how retailing businesses use competitive strategies and advanced information technologies to create competitive advantages, and how they manage relationships with stakeholders, including customers, suppliers, and policy makers.", "outcome": "", "syllabus": "", "required_readings": "", "recommended_readings": ""}, {"code": "5021", "title": "Shopping Mall Development and Management", "career": "Postgraduate - Taught", "units": "3.00", "grading": "Graded", "components": "Lecture", "campus": "Main Campus", "academic_group": "Div of Business Administration", "requirements": "For students in MSc Management of Real Estate and Hospitality Assets; or MSc Real Estate", "description": "Shopping mall is a dynamic business and has been one of the important assets in the investment portfolio.

The success of SHTM education hinges on our ability to connect theory to practice. This is a course to enable you to develop a framework to connect theory to practice. There are two specific course objectives:1. The first objective is to show you how an academic mind shapes an executive mind. We all want to become successful executives. A successful executive is someone who has an executive mind. An executive mind makes effective and efficient decisions. In the meantime, we come to study at a leading university because we want to master the best way to learn how to learn. The best learner is someone who has an academic mind. An academic mind has a firm grasp of literature and knows how to learn from current and historic great minds from different disciplines. When we have an academic mind that can guide our executive mind, we can benefit from literature and make well informed effective and efficient decisions. In this course, we introduce to you a way to see theories through daily actions and to see the relationship between theory and practice. Whenever a practice is highly significant, it pays to go to the root of the practice and make sure that there is a sound theory behind. In the meantime, in implementation, a sound practice will ensure that there is a thorough understanding of the sound theory behind.\u00a0Theory and practice are two sides of the same coin. When you have an academic mind to distil your work experience and link it to a theoretical framework, you will become much more powerful to make good use of your experience to accelerate learning. Experience without learning is hardship. Experience with learning generates personal satisfaction and growth. Learning hinges on whether one has an academic mind, the way to develop the ability to learn how to learn. The ideal of education at SHTM is to enable us to see the implication of a theory to improving practices and also to see a theory behind proven best practices. It is only possible when we have an academic mind.2. The second objective is to show you how to nurture an academic mind, the way to develop your ability to learn how to learn. We enable you to appreciate the beauty of the process to develop a body of scientific knowledge in business and social science in the context of the hospitality and real estate industries. This will give you an orientation to appreciate the contribution to literature from various business and social science disciplines, the challenge of problems in the hospitality and real estate industries, the nature of empirical evidence, the importance of journals, books, magazines and libraries, and the meaning of academic work.
