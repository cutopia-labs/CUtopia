After completing this course, students are expected to have a sound working knowledge of GIS and spatial data analysis and an ability to identify and apply proper analytical methods to problem solving, and to correctly and appropriately interpret and present analysis results.", "outcome": "Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to: understand concepts central to spatial data analysis be aware of the progress and challenges of GIS and spatial analytics in environment, health and public management present and interpret spatial data in the context of environment, health, and public management identify geographic patterns, understand underlying spatiotemporal processes, and make spatially-explicit prediction/simulation under different decision scenarios critically assess management decisions and draw policy implications by virtue of geo-spatial modeling and geo-analysis techniques discussed in class and applied in labs", "syllabus": "Lectures\u00a0Lecture 1: Spatial data and spatial data analysis \u00a0Lecture 2: Revealing inequalities (focus: mapping and geo-visualization)\u00a0Lecture 3: Taking advantage of special structure (focus: spatial sampling and interpolation)\u00a0Lecture 4: Identifying determinants (1) (focus: fundamental statistical analysis methods)Lecture 5: Identifying determinants (2) (focus: spatial regression and GWR)\u00a0Lecture 6: Governing mega-city region (focus: spatial network analysis)Lecture 7: Allocating resources (focus: spatial optimization)\u00a0Lecture 8: Forecasting the future (focus: geo-simulation) \u00a0\u00a0Lecture 9: Citizen as sensors (focus: location-based service)\u00a0Lecture 10: Course review\u00a0\u00a0Laboratories\u00a0Lab 1: Mapping and geo-visualization\u00a0Lab 2: Spatial sampling and interpolation\u00a0Lab 3: Conventional correlation/regression analysis \u00a0Lab 4: Spatial regression and GWR \u00a0Lab 5: Network analysis\u00a0Lab 6: Spatial optimization\u00a0Lab 7: Geo-simulation \u00a0Lab 8: Location-based service (mobile mapping)", "required_readings": "Basic Textbook:Oyana, Tonny J. and Margai, Florence. 2015.
