This course exposes students to a range of state-of-the-arts developments in biomedical engineering. It invites students from various disciplines to discuss the long-term societal impacts and ethical implications of these technological advances, particularly in human enhancements beyond therapy. The course starts by illustrating the many amazing designs in our human body and yet how vulnerable we are in terms of injuries, diseases and ageing. Examples on how modern biomedical engineering helps us face our human conditions are given, such as musculoskeletal prosthetics and orthotics, cardiovascular implants, neuroengineering, stem cells and regenerative medicine, gene editing, bionanotechnology, intelligence and artificial intelligence and senses and artificial senses, etc. A historical account of human quest for \u201cliving\u201d machine, including a brief coverage of modern movies on bionic human then follows. The course wraps up with some social, ethical and philosophical reflections on the above issues and on the meaning of being human, opening up questions concerning the perennial human quest of becoming super human.\r", "outcome": "", "syllabus": "", "required_readings": "", "recommended_readings": ""}, {"code": "2000", "title": "Introduction to Biomedical Engineering", "career": "Undergraduate", "units": "2.00", "grading": "Graded", "components": "LectureProjectInteractive Tutorial", "campus": "Main Campus", "academic_group": "Dept of Biomedical Engineering", "requirements": "Not for students who have taken BMEG1130 or BMEG2001 or BMEG2130 or ESTR2200 or ESTR2201.", "description": "This course covers the definition, scope, basic principles and problems in biomedical engineering, introduction to the enabling technologies for biomedical engineering.
