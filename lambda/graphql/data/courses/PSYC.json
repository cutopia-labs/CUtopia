MORE IMPORTANTLY, we have set up 8 web discussions for which students have to provide their ideas for various topics (see below). To provide informative and insightful ideas and thus get good marks for these questions, students will not only have to understand the lectures, but also do extra readings.

Attach the title, journal name, issue number, page number, and abstract of the study at the end of your post (these would not count towards the word limit).

If I can fall asleep at 3am, that would be really early. Sometimes I can\u2019t sleep until 5 or 6. Usually I spend 1-2 hours in bed before falling asleep, even if I wait until 3pm to get in bed. That\u2019s very frustrating. The more I urge myself to fall asleep the harder it becomes. I tried going to bed earlier for a few days, but it didn\u2019t help. I still couldn\u2019t sleep until 3 or 4. So I tend to get up late, around 11-12. Still, after dinner, I often feel extremely sleepy and can\u2019t help having a nap. I can nap almost immediately whenever I get on a bus during the day too. I have a coffee every day, usually after brunch, which is around 2-3. On Tuesdays and Thursdays I have to go to a Tai Chi class at 8 in the morning, and you can imagine how hard it is for me to get up. I\u2019ve not tried any sleep pills, as I heard that they are addictive and would lose effect after some time. Ah \u2013 I usually go to shower at 11pm and then watch TV and read newspaper before going to bed. I tried to shower earlier for a few days but it didn\u2019t help.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Topic 3 - In less than 150 words, interpret the following dream. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0You can make use of this (http://www.dreammoods.com/dreamdictionary/) and other dream dictionaries to help you, but you are not limited to that.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThere is my brother Dave. He is leisurely jogging up a green slope. He got all the way to the top and there my friend Nelson is hugging a woman. Their faces are softened by mild, rosy light of the setting sun. Gradually they dissolved into the dense, orange air\u2026 Suddenly everything disappears and I find myself in bed. I tried to go back to the slope I dream of but I can\u2019t. So I get up and open the door. I see a long beach. The air is brisk and the sun hasn\u2019t come out yet. The tide is full and water is rushing into my bedroom\u2026\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Web Discussion 2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Topic 1 - Mind-enhancing drugs should be encouraged for students in CUHK\u00a0In less than 100 words, give one argument for and one argument against the above notion.

An example would be a self-confidence boosting CD containing subliminal messages of encouraging words played backwards.

There is no model answer to this question, and depending on the purpose in answering this question the same person may come up with different criteria. Therefore it is good enough to clearly state your criterion and explain why it is chosen among other possible criteria.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Web Discussion 7 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Topic 1 \u2013 Libet\u2019s Experiment and Free Will\u00a0If, based on the results of Libet\u2019s ERP experiment discussed in class, someone concludes that humans have no free will, would you agree? If not, what is your position? Within 100 words, state your position and provide a strong reason to justify your position. Whether the reason is clear and convincing is the key. It is fine whether you think of the reason yourself or use a reason from the literature, but in the latter case you have to provide the reference.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Topic 2 \u2013 How Much \u201cHuman\u201d Is Human Enough?\u00a0Suppose you undergo a surgery such that 30% of your brain cells are replaced by computer chips.

If you do not have an answer for (a) you can describe two ideas for (b). The goal of this exercise is for you to reflect on what you learned from this course.
