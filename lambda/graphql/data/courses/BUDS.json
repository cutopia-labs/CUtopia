"description": "The renowned Dunhuangologist Ji Xianlin (1911-2009) once pointed out: \u201cThere are only four cultural systems in the world which have been recognized as having a long history, a vast geographical span, a selfcontained cultural system as well as far-reaching impacts \u2013 China, India, Greece and Islam; the fifth one does not exist. There is only one place where all four of these cultural systems converge \u2013 the region of Dunhuang and Xinjiang in China, and no more.\u201dThe murals and statues in Dunhuang Grottoes are well preserved through different dynasties, and have aesthetic style sourced from different cultures. Dunhuang is very rich in many aspects, namely: art and culture, history and archaeology. However, the most precious out of so many valuable cultural relics is the Buddhist iconography and with the Buddhist teaching and philosophy within. This course is specially designed to offer an inspiring and in-depth introduction of Buddhist teaching and philosophy through Dunhuang Buddhist iconography. The historical and cultural background, the related aesthetic and archaeology aspects will also be introduced.Its coverage includes areas such as the essence of the teaching in Buddhism: Dependent Origination, Cause & Effect, the Noble Eightfold Path (Middle Path), the idea of \u2018non-self\u2019, karma theory, nirv\u0101na etc.; the Concept of Pure Land, the cult of Guanyin and Maitreya in China, and also the history of the spread and inheritance of Buddhist iconography from 4th to 14th centuries in China.The course is intended for individuals who are interested in the Buddhist studies and want to study Buddhism and its practice as a means for spiritual development in a comprehensive way. It is also for participants who interested to study Buddhist teachings through Dunhuang Buddhist iconography and adding a new dimension to their spirituality and apply the Buddhist teaching into their daily lives, move along from suffering towards sustainable happiness.", "outcome": "Upon completion of this course, students should be able to:\r\u00a01.

Longstanding Buddhist scriptural traditions have existed in diverse languages across Asia for over two thousand years, and Buddhist concepts are notoriously difficult to translate. English has emerged as the key, common language for the translating Buddhist writings and for conducting scholarship on Buddhism worldwide.  This course is intended for students, fluent in Chinese and with a background in Buddhist Studies, who want to improve their abilities to read English-language scholarship and translations. The course is also intended for anyone, including those whose English is already strong, who wants an introduction to how Buddhism is studied in Western scholarship. In this course, students will practice reading about Buddhism in English, will learn about scholarly conventions for translating Buddhist terms, and will become proficient in pronouncing and composing Indic Buddhist technical terms in Romanized script.  This course will be integrated with the English Language Teaching Unit\u2019s (ELTU) English Across the Curriculum (EAC) program, which will provide assistance to students in their English-language learning needs.", "outcome": "By the end of the course students will be able to: Read Buddhist English-language scholarship and translations, with deeper understanding of the conventions and ambiguities in such writing; Pronounce and produce (with the required diacritical marks) on computer the common Indic (mainly Pali and Sanskrit) Buddhist terms necessary in modern scholarship; and Translate passages on Buddhism between English and Chinese, with informed use of the best current dictionaries and glossaries.", "syllabus": " Course introduction: Overview of Buddhist languages and texts, and reference works for translating between languages.

We will examine in-depth four key moments of paradigm shift in Chinese religious culture, in the Warring States Period (481-256 BC) before the arrival of Buddhism, the Period of Division (220-589 AD), the Song-Yuan (960-1368), and modern China (1850-present). One focus of the course is to investigate how Buddhism interacted with local religious culture in China through a variety of confluences and conflicts in relationship to changing social, political, and economic systems. We will review foundational debates from the 20th century, such as \u2018Buddhist conquest of China\u2019 and \u2018Chinese transformation of Buddhism\u2019 or the \u2018Sinification of Buddhism.\u2019", "outcome": "On successful completion of the module students will be able to: demonstrate an advanced critical knowledge of the historical development of Buddhism in China from its introduction around the turn of the Common Era through\u00a0the new challenges it has faced in modern China (1850-present). situate Buddhism as a part of Chinese religious tradition in its relationship with indigenous beliefs and practices; know how Buddhist universalism transformed the native Daoist religion and society, contributing \u00a0to fundamental changes in the vision of self and the practice of government, as well as alternative lifestyles and forms of social empowerment for women.", "syllabus": " The Issue of definition and unified whole Kinship-based ancestor worship and Shamanism of the Royal period The Emergence of Self-Cultivation Practice and Qi-based Cosmology in Warring States State Religion in Period of Political Unity Paradigm shift and Religious transformations brought in by Buddhism Scripture and the Three Religions Literature and the Three Religions The Three Religions in the Song Temple-centric society since the Song: Rural versus Urban Buddhism for the Elite versus Popular Modern attack on religion and the Buddhist reform in the Twentieth Century Gender and the Buddhist alternative lifestyles and empowerment for women Buddhist Conquest of China or Sinification of Buddhism", "required_readings": "1.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0General required readings for the course Z\u00fcrcher, Erik.
