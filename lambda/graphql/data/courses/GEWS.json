Part I of the course provides a brief historical background to European politics and sets the scene for the course, in examining theoretically how contemporary \u2018populism\u2019 is defined and conceptualized in the 21st century political landscape. Part II of the course provides the main focus of the course, in focusing on the main causes and drivers that have led to the growth of (a) radical right-wing populism and (b) radical left-wing populism. Three key approaches are drawn on in Part II of the course, with comparative studies, survey research (public opinion) and case studies across Western Europe and Central-Eastern Europe allowing students to understand about the diversity and variations of populism in the contemporary political landscape. Part III of the course introduces students to critical debates and evaluations on the \u2018rise\u2019 of populism and just how important understanding this political phenomenon is for (a) the implications for contemporary democracy and governance in EU member states, alongside (b) how populism on the \u2018right\u2019 and \u2018left\u2019 of the political spectrum is challenging the future EU project. Part III of the course also draws briefly on comparisons between the primary causes of \u2018populism\u2019 in the European context, to the causes of \u2018localism\u2019 in the Hong Kong context.The final part of the course also revisits the premise and assumption made in Part I of the course, about the historical stability of the European political landscape by outlining how a shift has taken place, with \u2018a new form of politics\u2019 now existing in European politics. Stability and patterns of partisan alignment have now been replaced by instability and widespread patterns of electoral volatility. \r", "outcome": "", "syllabus": "", "required_readings": "", "recommended_readings": ""}, {"code": "2131", "title": "Hong Kong Myths", "career": "Undergraduate", "units": "3.00", "grading": "Graded", "components": "Lecture", "campus": "Main Campus", "academic_group": "Lee Woo Sing College", "requirements": "For Lee Woo Sing College students only.", "description": "As an international city, Hong Kong has been praised in world class financial services; one of the most efficient governments in the globe; a vibrant and pluralistic globalized city which can serve as the bridge between China and the West even after the handover in 1997.
