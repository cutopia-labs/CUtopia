Every opportunity is taken to reinforce the economic concepts with current data, particularly for the U.S. and China. We then proceed to examine the policy instruments used to steer an economy towards the objectives of sustainable growth, stable inflation and low unemployment. Broadly speaking, these policy tools are monetary policy, implemented by a country's central bank, and fiscal policy implemented by the government when it makes expenditure and taxation decisions. We extend our exposition of traditional monetary policy to explain the Federal Reserve's quantitative easing, as well as the essential factors contributing to the financial crisis which necessitated this unconventional monetary policy. We then move onto the interactions between economies as captured in their respective balance of payment accounts and exchange rate movements. Fluctuations in China's RMB will be closely analyzed at this point and open the door for an in-depth look into China's domestic imbalances.

Dramatic changes in information technology (IT) and business activities are forcing firms to come up with new ways of organizing work. Similarly, new types of digital information goods, much lower search costs, innovative ways of doing marketing, management, finance and human resource all lead to the disruption of old business models and creation of new ones.This course uses economic theory to investigate the roles of information and technology in the existing diversity of organizations and markets and in enabling the creating of new organizational forms. The class is designed for PhD students in management, economics, information technology, marketing, operations management, organizational behavior and related disciplines. For economists, this class offers the opportunity to apply economic tools to understand how information technology and information in general affect organizations and markets. For non-economists, this class offers an exposure to fundamental ideas in the economics of information, organizations, and markets. This course covers quantitative research methodologies in Economics of IS. It consists of three components: Methodology, Economics of IS Research Topics, and Writing and Publishing. The main goal is to prepare PhD students to produce publication quality research using tools from information economics.We will cultivate a culture of collaborative learning. In particular, in this seminar class, students come prepared to engage in thoughtful discussions of the materials. Students are asked to write informal, short memos prior to several of the classes. These memos will generally be responses to some questions or issues we pose prior to each class.
