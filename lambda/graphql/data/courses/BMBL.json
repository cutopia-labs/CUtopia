Signing varieties\u00a0 Signing is a cover term for a wide array of varieties which reflects at the one end of the continuum the grammar of spoken languages and at the other end the grammar of natural sign languages. Examples of signing varieties include\u00a0 natural sign languages, manually coded spoken languages, fingerspelling, cued speech, tactile signing, etc.   Sign Language Acquisition\u00a0 It covers different types of acquisition processes involving sign languages, which may be L1 acquisition of sign languages by deaf or hearing individuals in a monolingual fashion, or bimodal bilingual acquisition of both a sign language and a spoken language in early childhood \u00a0or entering adulthood.  \u00a0\u00a0", "required_readings": "There will be:\u00a01.

Students will practice transcribing some signs using the Stokoe System.   Sign Language Phonetics Some major findings of articulatory phonetics in sign languages will be discussed.   Common Phonological Processes in Sign Languages\u00a0 This unit presents common phonological processes and changes that have been found in the world\u2019s sign languages. Students will practice how to identify processes that result in historical changes and sociolinguistic variations.   Sequentiality vs simultaneity in sign language phonology This unit presents the evidence that motivates a model of phonology that takes into account the sequential and simultaneous properties of signs.   Handshape as a phonological parameter This unit presents the generalizations that have been made about how handshapes are configured and constrained in sign languages and how phonological models have attempted to account for these patterns.   Location as a phonological parameter This unit looks into the subcategories of locations, their respective characteristics and how they can be represented in phonological models.   Movement as a phonological parameter This unit presents the different types of movements and their characteristics. It also reviews the controversies surrounding the phonological status of movement as an independent category.

Different modes of interpreting (e.g. sight translation, consecutive interpreting, simultaneous interpreting) and different models of sign language interpreting will be discussed. Discourses commonly found in local sign interpretation will be introduced (e.g. health, education, legal, social work, business and government, etc.). As an international development, the roles of Deaf interpreters to serve a broader purpose of communication are highlighted. Students are expected to be able to compare the development of local sign interpreting to that of Mainland China, Macau, and other countries.", "outcome": "Students completing this course will achieve a basic understanding that:\u00a01. Different modes of interpreting (e.g., sight translation, consecutive interpreting, and simultaneous interpreting) serve different purpose in communication access;\u00a02.

Sight translation provides instant access of written text to signers. Apart from competing in their time duration of interpreting, consecutive and simultaneous interpreting also differ in terms of its translation production clarity and appropriate use in different discourse.   Models of Sign Language Interpreting Answering the needs of service consumers, sign language interpreting models develop from helper model, machine model, communication facilitator model, bilingual-bicultural model, to nowadays ally model.   Discourses and Demands Different discourses call for different demands and qualifications of interpreters. They have to equip themselves with different knowledge, both encyclopedic and specialized, in order to relay the messages between their service consumers. Interpreters have to be alert to the register choice, as well as the intended and extended meaning implied in different discourses. On top of our everyday languages Hong Kong Sign Language and Cantonese, other languages, like English and Mandarin, might also be a different demand due to the post-colonial status of our city.   Deaf Interpreters Deaf interpreters have been introduced as unimodal interpreters in international conferences and as language expert in regional setting. The widely use of deaf interpreters has become an international trend and providing better access to the service consumers, especially for those who are Deaf-Blind, elderly Deaf, Deaf-plus, Deaf children, and Deaf foreigners. In terms of human rights empowerment, their roles also serve the purpose of Deaf individuals as language models.  ", "required_readings": "There will be:\u00a01.

Language acquisition beyond this period displays diversity in ultimate attainment.   Impoverished Input Linguistic data that is supposedly sensitive enough to trigger language acquisition is neither perceived nor processed efficiently due to hearing loss. Alternatively, the so-called language data that deaf children are exposed to show intrinsic characteristics that mar sensitive linguistic input.   Sign bilingualism vs bimodal bilingualism Sign Bilingualism refers to a form of education philosophy for the deaf that promotes use of sign language in education to nurture the \u2018L1\u2019 acquisition of deaf and hard-of-hearing children. Subsequent inclusion of spoken language in the education process is taken to be supporting L2 acquisition.
