This will include active exploration and manipulation of concrete materials and technological visualizations.This course will study teaching methods and key sequences for developing young children\u2019s concepts and knowledge in the following: number, space, measurement, chance and data, patterns, body structure and functions, living and nonliving things, plants and animals, energy, water and gas, and simple toys. Participants will be able to master the skills to help young children acquire simple specific skills, such as observing and recording changes, making predictions and assumptions, and classifying objects.\r", "outcome": "At the end of the course, participants will:\r\u00a01. demonstrate an awareness and understanding of concepts in mathematics, science and technology appropriate to the early childhood years; and\r\u00a02. plan and prepare learning activities and experiences that enhance the development of young children in mathematics, science and technology.\r\u00a03.

The interrelated development of empathetic understanding, imagination, and creativity through the arts will be discussed. Focus will be given to the design of activities that facilitate young children's appreciation and creative expressions of different forms of arts. These forms encompass visual arts (e.g. drawings, paintings, handicraft, sculpture, photography), language arts (e.g. picture books, poems, fairy tales), expressive arts (e.g. music, dance, drama), and the integrated arts. All the above forms could be actualized in various kinds of play, which serve as an ideal form for creative expressions. With the view to uncovering the dynamics of creativity development, we shall pay attention to the processes of symbolic mediation (internalization and externalization processes inclusive). Recognizing that creativity is the essence of human existence, deliberations will be given to facilitate creative expressions of a young child in the context of kindergartens, home, and community.", "outcome": "", "syllabus": "", "required_readings": "", "recommended_readings": ""}, {"code": "4320", "title": "Introduction to Educational Research", "career": "Undergraduate", "units": "3.00", "grading": "Graded", "components": "DiscussionLectureOthersInteractive Tutorial", "campus": "Main Campus", "academic_group": "BA(ECE) Pgm Comm", "requirements": "", "description": "This course will introduce to the students the basic constructs of educational research and prepare them for carrying out a project of field inquiry into early childhood education, which is required by the program.
