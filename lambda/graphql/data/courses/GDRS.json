Having the gender lens in qualitative research lends itself greater importance as it helps to uncover the mechanism and the intersectional social forces giving shape to forms of inequalities, identities, and communities. As AI and big data are the buzz words today to restructure the future work force, qualitative research skills are becoming increasingly important in a world that are gradually governed by machines. People are not satisfied with merely algorithmic associations but want to know the meanings, emotions, sensibility, and identities behind data. Qualitative methods in gender studies capacitate us to engage in deep reflection about the process, dynamics, and the deeper structure of the social world to come up with a better solution to many problems of inequality. Gender studies is an interdisciplinary field, but in this course, we will focus on the qualitative research methods used by feminist inquires in the social sciences. Students will be exposed to a variety of qualitative research methods from fieldwork to beyond. Epistemology of gender research and what is considered feminist research will be introduced. We will cover important qualitative cases and the associated ethical issues.

Based on a cross-cultural perspective, we will read and analyze different meanings of gender and sexuality, and how these meanings are constructed. In a context of modernization campaigns and globalization processes, this course illustrates how gender relations and sexual politics are related with historical backgrounds, cultural heritage, market expansion, ideological shifts, and capitalist dynamics. The topics of gender and sexuality will be interwoven with that of migration, work, family, popular culture, mass media, and consumerism. The course will help students to understand issues of discrimination against women and girls, unpaid care and domestic work, access to sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights, and equal rights to economic resources, and to reflect on how to promote gender equality (SDG5 among 17 Sustainable Development Goals, SDGs, in the 2030 development agenda). Students will be encouraged to explore localized knowledge and living experiences of gender and sexuality, and to think critically about how to reduce inequality (SDG10) related to social systems of sex and gender.", "outcome": " 1.

Specifically, it is concerned with living out feminist consciousness in every step of making fundamental and lasting social change. With this in mind, Living Feminisms is not an exposition of feminist theories per se but an exploration of how social change effort would look like when we take up feminist consciousness that transcends separateness and duality. It explores the root causes that lead to the domination system that has plagued humanity for centuries, examines the possibility of having a fundamental and lasting social transformation that supports life of all, and takes a closer look at a few selected alternative practices such as restorative justice and sharing economies that hold out hope in times of crises. The course also equips students with practical knowledge of being a change agent, introducing some practices with feminist consciousness that transform limiting beliefs about social change, nourish resilience by taking care of social and political trauma, and cultivate need-based facilitation skills and leadership that help navigate conflicts in the process of making internal as well as external transformation. To put it in a nutshell, Living Feminisms is a course that cultivates change agents with feminist consciousness.Living Feminisms deeply resonates with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015 as a blueprint for building a sustainable future by 2030. The course directly touches on alternative practices working towards the SDGs 5 (Gender Equality), 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), 10 (Reduced Inequalities), 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), 16 (Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions) and 17 (Partnerships for the Goals). ", "outcome": " Upon completion of the course, students will acquire both knowledge and skills of social change that are in line with feminist consciousness. Specifically, they will be able to explain the roots of the domination system and a series of factors contributing to its perpetuation, and able to make change by transforming internal and external resistance. Students will be empowered to take lead in change effort through collaboration with others and mastery of conflict transformation skills.\u00a0Students will learn to appreciate making a sustainable future requires transformation in areas broader than the conventionally defined economic realm.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0", "syllabus": " Class 1: How We Got Where We Are and Where Are We Heading? \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Riane Eisler and Douglas P.

We will draw on an array of intellectual resources ranging from political economy, critical race theory, feminism, phenomenology and queer theory to examine issues about racial/ethnic minorities, the economically underprivileged, minorities with disabilities, sexual/erotic minorities, gender minorities and youth in light of the latest scholarly discussions on multiculturalism, pluralism and the politics of difference and social recognition.The course is relevant to the Sustainable Development Goals 5 (Gender Equality), 10 (Reduced Inequalities) and 16 (Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions)

It explores processes of how the family is constructed in different forms as it intersects with various social systems including kinship, marriage, class, ethnicity, religion, and political economy. Particular attention is paid to how family as a gendered construction, while being a basic principle of social life globally, exhibits great diversity as it shapes and is shaped by local histories, traditions, and state policies. In an era of globalization and transnational mobility, the ideology and practice of the family are rapidly changing, but there are simultaneously trends of reversion and localization. Students will read ethnographies and develop cross-cultural perspectives on classic and contemporary issues concerning the family, such as work and domesticity, motherhoods and fatherhoods, sexual orientations, reproductive technologies, surrogacy and adoption. Students learn to critically think and articulate about family issues, and will acquire enhanced knowledge and skills in reflexive thinking and positive communication, cultural sensitivity, and diversity and inclusion. The course is relevant to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015, in particular SDGs 5 (Gender Equality), 10 (Reduced Inequalities) and 16 (Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions).", "outcome": " Upon completion of the course, students will be able to:  describe anthropologically the different forms of family and the reasons they exist in different cultures, and have a broad-base understanding and worldview of the diversity of human experiences.  engage in contemporary debates in relation to the definition of family, same-sex parenthood and reproductive technologies, and to develop skills to dissipate stereotypes and discriminatory practices regarding sexual orientations.  analyze issues surrounding domesticity and violence against women in different cultural settings, and investigate potential solutions for gender inequality and evaluate barriers to related problems in their own society.  reflect on and apply concepts of cultural relativism, and to analyze ethnocentrism and explore ways to terminate racial discrimination.  reflect on their ability and steps to take as change-makers and agents of justice and peace.", "syllabus": "  1. The Family: An anthropological perspective (SDG #5, 10, 16)  The family is often imagined to be a social institution with a set of values and relationships shared by everyone in society. This is far from reality. In this lecture we look at the definitions of family across cultures, and look at how family interacts with different social systems such as religion, political system and modes of production, and investigate how family values may differ in different ethnic groups and how they change over time. Concepts of cultural relativism and holism will be introduced.\u00a0  \u00a0  2. Kinship and lineage\u00a0(SDG #5, 10)  Kinship and lineage have played an important part in the political economy of society, in the past as well as in present time. In this lecture we discuss the commonalities as well as the differences across cultures, and look at the factors leading to continuity and/or change, such as urbanization, globalization, appearance of reproductive technologies, adoption, surrogacy, and changing values in sexuality.  \u00a0  3. Role of marriage in family\u00a0(SDG #5, 10, 16)  This lecture looks at how marriage may or may not be related to family formation, and the role of marriage in society. In addition, marriage regulations and practices are highly related to gender ideologies. These relations exist in diverse forms and have transformed over time, for example as governments promulgate new marriage laws and as civil society demands for reform.  \u00a0  4. Domesticity and gender division of labor\u00a0(SDG #5, 10, 16)  How was the idea \u201cman are breadwinners; women are homemakers\u201d formulated in history and how is it challenged in contemporary society? This lecture will discuss issues of domesticity and how gender division of labor at home is related to the gender division of labor in society. We will examine the roles of religion and science, as well as of the church and\u00a0 government in the production of gendered social arrangements. Students will learn to identify systemic barriers to gender equality.\u00a0  \u00a0  5. Violence against Women\u00a0(SDG #5, 16)  Why are women the majority of victims of domestic violence across cultures? Why do many women choose to stay in abusive relations? In this lecture we look at the social and cultural factors that influence women\u2019s decision to confront, escape, or endure domestic violence, and discuss how family and \u00a0ideologies and practices have played a part in the perpetuation of VAW in different cultures. Students will investigate potential solutions for VAW as a form of gender inequality.  \u00a0  6. Parenthood and socialization\u00a0(SDG #5, 10)  Do all parents love their children? Do parents in different cultures raise their children the same way? Why is raising children in families with same-sex parents, single parents, and migrant parents considered problematic? If socialization is the way to reproduce socially acceptable individuals, what form, content, and means should it take? This lecture seeks to dispel the misconception that parent-child relations are natural and uniform, by looking at the diverse forms of parenthood and ways of socialization in different cultures.  \u00a0  7. Spousal relations: duties, affection, and intimacy\u00a0(SDG #5, 10)  How is spousal relationship culturally constructed? What are the components of spouse-hood and how do they relate to politics, economics, religion and other social systems? Why do extra-marital affairs happen and how does society deal with it? This lecture looks at the ideology and practice of spouse-hood across different cultures, and asks what role it has in formulating the family as social institution. \u00a0\u00a0  \u00a0  8. Globalization, affluence and livelihood\u00a0(SDG #5, 10, 16)  This lecture looks at global transformation processes and how they affect the family both as a social institution and as a network of related individuals. We look at how consumerism, social media, and converging values seemingly sync-ing familial structures and emotions across the globe, but at the same time noting how families in different societies, as they undergo globalization and wealth polarization, are torn by desires of economic growth and downward social mobility.\u00a0  \u00a0  9. Transnational mobility and family\u00a0(SDG #5, 10)  In an era of globalization, more and more people cross national borders for a better life, creating transnational families as family members live in different countries in the form of split households, or as individuals become members of family in a different culture. In this lecture we look at this growing phenomenon and discuss issues about acculturation, family relations and power dynamics, how affines and agnates create transnational communities, and what happens to those who are left behind in the hometown.  \u00a0  10. New kinship and alternative family\u00a0(SDG #5, 10)  We will discuss how arrangements such as same-sex marriage, cohabitation, and polygamous relations would challenge conventional understandings of kinship and family in society. We will reflect on these issues in relation to contemporary debates on heterosexual normativity, monogamy, and same-sex relations.  \u00a0  11. Doing family in China\u00a0(SDG #5, 16)  The concept of family has various levels of meanings in Chinese culture, and throughout Chinese history these have transformed in response to the needs and ideologies of the time. While Han families may share certain idealized views of the family as a social system, its practice is perhaps as varied as the number of families. Ethnic groups and Chinese overseas communities add to this complexity as their worldviews, religions, and socioeconomic environments acculturate thinking and behavior that differ from what is understood as Chinese core values.  \u00a0  12. Doing family in Asia\u00a0(SDG #5, 16)  This lecture will bring together ethnographic cases in Asia to illustrate the interaction of different social systems revolving around the family. By comparing changes and continuities of family formation and relations in the region using a cross-cultural perspective, we are able to reflect on our own culture, and understand the pros and cons of the ideologies and practices that we are socialized in.\u00a0  \u00a0  13. Family, power, and intersectionality\u00a0(SDG #5, 10, 16)  This lecture discusses individuals\u2019 multi-layered identities and how these intersect with family membership. We will examine roles, statuses and power generated from positions in the family, gender and ethnicity, at work and school, on the media and more. The multiple locales in which individuals perform their everyday experiences are examined holistically, which helps us rethink how seemingly \u201cnatural\u201d behavior are really cultural constructs, and how taken-for-granted ideas of family membership shape our everyday lives, our life goals as individuals, and the regulations and resources that constitute society.  \u00a0 \u00a0", "required_readings": " 1.

From award-winning movies, heart-warming testimonies, tabloid stories to Facebook groups and social campaigns, we have been consuming, constructing, and circulating narratives of \u2018the past\u2019. This act of remembering and exploring \u2018our history\u2019 questions a mainstream Hong Kong story of success demonstrated by economic development and material wealth, and attempts to identify discontinuities, gaps and silenced voices in the dominating narrative. It has also prompted reflections on the relation between narrative and identity \u2014 personal, collective, and spatial \u2014 in historical inquiry, and in what ways the writing of history has been shaped by disparate ideals, values, web of relations and power. This course will revisit Hong Kong\u2019s history through the exploration of narratives documenting women, a group often made invisible in history writing, as social actors in the fabric of colonial Hong Kong. From elites\u2019 households to textile factories, from rural villages, western-district brothels to mid-levels convents, schools and hospitals, women of different generations have worked as caregivers, breadwinners, pioneers, and educators while contesting the prescribed subordinate status as objects of exploitation in a patriarchal society. Drawing from a wide range of sources, including archival documents, published biographies, autobiographies, memoirs, family histories, school histories, and oral histories, this course will seek to introduce a multi-faceted history of colonial Hong Kong with women as the focus of inquiry. The discussion of women\u2019s narratives will be situated in respective historical contexts linking the personal to social, political and economic changes in Hong Kong under colonial rule. It will also discuss the use of auto/biographies and oral histories as a methodology in historical research investigating the relations between memory, self and identity.The course resonates with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015 by directly engaging in critical reflections that help students work towards the SDGs 5 (Gender Equality), 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), 10 (Reduced Inequalities), 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), and 16 (Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions).", "outcome": " It is anticipated that on completing the course, students will be able to:  \u00a0 \u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 identify major areas and topics regarding the study of women\u2019s lives and experiences in Hong Kong history  \u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 analyse and discuss in what ways gender has been an organizing force in shaping families, professions, education, and social movements in Hong Kong history  \u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 examine one\u2019s self identity in complex historical and social contexts  \u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 evaluate competing narratives of a \u2018Hong Kong Story\u2019 from a gender and historical perspective  \u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 apply first-hand knowledge and skills in writing history relating the personal to the social, cultural, political and economic contexts  \u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 recognize the interconnections between different sources of inequality and oppression \u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0critically engage with notions of social justice and social transformation  \u00a0  \u00a0", "syllabus": "\u00a0A\u00a0 INTRODUCTION \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1 Introduction: Revisiting Hong Kong\u2019s history (1840s -1990s) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2 Methodology: Narrative, Auto/biography and Oral HistoryB\u00a0 WOMEN IN THE FAMILY: Servitude, Lineage, and Family Networks in pre-war Hong Kong\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 3 Protected Women, san po tsai, mui tsai and concubines \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 4 Village women and boat women\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 5 Merchants\u2019 daughters: women in the elite families \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 C\u00a0 WOMEN AND FEMALE EDUCATION : From Protection to Modernisation\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 6 European missionaries and nuns\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 7 Local headmistresses and teachers\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 8 Girls going to school and universityD\u00a0 WOMEN AT WORK: Gender, Work and Professions\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 9 Brothel keepers and prostitutes in the 19th Century\u00a0\u00a0 10 Nurses and doctors (1920s-1980s)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 11 Factory workers (1960s-1990s)\u00a0E\u00a0 WOMEN IN PHILANTHROPY AND SOCIAL ACTIVISM (1910s-1970s): Public Voice for the Private Sphere\u00a0\u00a0 12 Leaders of the anti-mui tsai campaign, the campaign against licensed prostitution, the\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 YWCA and the Family Planning Association", "required_readings": "Primary SourcesSelected documents from archives of mission societies, girls\u2019 schools, and charities.Published Secondary SourcesHong Kong History and Women\u2019s HistoryNgo, Tak-wing (ed.)

Gender, as one of the building blocks of society and culture, shapes our values and is deeply embedded in our daily lives, and it weaves an intricate ideological fabric that strongly impacts our thoughts, feelings and action.  Through the exploration of selected issues in Chinese culture which are significant and relevant to everyday life, this course introduces to students historical materials which relate to, and contemporary research on, the role of gender in the making of history and culture, and how history and culture work to shape our understanding of gender. As they participate in the learning activities of the course, students will be gradually led to understand Chinese culture from a new perspective. Furthermore, students will have a chance to reflect on long-held values and beliefs which they themselves have acquired as members of this culture, or which they witness in the daily life of the community around them. While helping students to further understand the Chinese culture and history in a new gendered perspective, this course resonates with the Sustanable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by United Nations, including SDG 5 (Gender Equality) and SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities). Students reflect on their various values and concepts in daily life through this course, and become a global citizen with an open mind.", "outcome": "(1)

The discussions focus on both the structural constraints that LGBTQI+ people face, but also the agency and resilience they display. It explores the development of contemporary LGBTQI+ identities and social movements, as well as the politics involved.

Importantly, gender is among the powerful individual characteristics that affect people's experiences in educational and work settings. Gender shapes youths' experience and outcomes of education across the globe and across history. This course is designed to introduce to students, with a critical mindset, important contemporary issues at the intersection of gender, education and jobs. The topics address the role of gender in school- and related preferences and achievements, with a focus on social and cognitive approaches. For example, what is quality education (SDG goal 4) and why is it important to evaluate it with a gender perspective? Do men and women really differ in their abilities, and if so, by how much? Is personal interest a better explanation of gender imbalances in occupations? What are the ways that biases exist in education and the workplace, and how do teachers, parents, and employers contribute to gender biases (SDG goal 5)? Can gender equality in performance and hiring be improved by removing stereotypes? The literature will cover childhood, adolescence as well as adulthood in order to provide insight into the age-related changes of the gender issues. Particular attention will be paid to issues that relate closely to daily life, both local and international. Empirical evidence will be reviewed to illustrate the gender biases and substantiate the explanatory theories.

This course examines the gender dimensions of innovation and novelty. The key questions are: How/Why/What/When innovation(s) are gendered? We will discuss the fluidity and messiness of doing and undoing gender in innovation practices and meanings produced. Broadly defined, innovation refers to new ideas, new knowledge, new technologies, new designs, and creative practices with the goal to solve social or technical problems. Many innovations may seem gender-neutral but are inherently imbued with gender perceptions. The course will equip students with ways to apply gender analysis to decipher innovations and innovative processes. The course incorporates sustainable development goals (SDGs) on Gender Equality and Reduced Inequalities to become more discerning toward more sustainable practices to advance Industry Innovation and Infrastructure. Using case studies from the technology culture, the routine practices, and the emergent new economy, students will learn to untangle how gender intersects with the seemingly neutral artefacts of innovation and technology.

Topics will include the key semiotic and psychoanalytic approaches of the 1970s-1990s, classic films which have inspired feminist debate, avant-garde cinema, local cinema, independent cinema, and postmodern cinema, as well as recent cinematic re-conceptualizations and exploration of gender and sexuality local and abroad. In systems of representation from fine art to mainstream cinema to advertising, women have been constructed and existed as spectacle or passive object \u201cto-be-looked-at,\u201d in Laura Mulvey\u2019s now often quoted words. Following her trail, feminist critics turned their attention to mainstream films and popular media addressed to female spectators and exposed the contradictions within and between the notion of \u201cwomen\u2019s pictures\u201d and the diversity of female experience. Local cinemas and independent creators also tell their own unique stories of women\u2019s lives in dramatically different cultural contexts. Critics from other fields further complicate these images by examining them through lens including race, class, ability, queerness, and more.Mulvey\u2019s groundbreaking analysis of gendered looking relations in classical Hollywood cinema has since generated numerous analyses of the place of women as spectacle or passive object in films \u201ccut to the measure of [male] desire.\u201d Critics around the world showed how different groups of women attempt to take control of their positioning through viewing or using texts in their own ways, and by creating their own. What happens when female-identified artists, audiences, and theorists look back, and seek to rebel against such cinematic traditions by experimenting with alternative visual languages and narrative tools? This course starts with the paradigm of narrative film analysis that Mulvey outlined in the 1970s and move on to explore a wider range of questions in feminist film studies, including spectatorship, authorship, popular culture, character stereotypes in genre films, self-representation, (g)local cinema, and new feminist media. Students would be introduced to trailblazing works by female filmmakers worldwide, special focus will be placed onto important works in Hong Kong cinema for critical examination and comparative studies. Through critical reflections on notions such as gender stereotypes, representation, power, diversity, and equality, the course engages directly with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015 by engaging directly with the SDGs 5 (Gender Equality) and 10 (Reduced Inequalities).", "outcome": "", "syllabus": "", "required_readings": "", "recommended_readings": ""}, {"code": "3103", "title": "Gender Studies: Field Study II", "career": "Undergraduate", "units": "3.00", "grading": "Graded", "components": "Field Studies/Field-tripInteractive Tutorial", "campus": "Main Campus", "academic_group": "Gender Studies Pgm Comm", "requirements": "", "description": "The course is conducted by the teaching staff from this Programme.

We will look at Filipina, Vietnamese and Chinese women migrating to Taiwan, Korea, Japan and the United States for marriage and employment. We will discuss issues related to labor and marriage migrations, as well as trafficking in women, on both macro- and micro-levels. We are going to ask: how does the global economic restructuring shape the gendered migration today? What makes female labor different from male labor in the global labor market? What are push-and-pull factors that trigger these women to leave their hometown to be workers or wives in foreign countries? What difficulties do they experience after entering host societies and what impact would the migration flow bring to both laborer/bride receiving and sending countries? Moreover, we will explore the global market formation of transnational commodified marriages between women from developing countries and men from more developed countries. Taking the matchmaking industry in Taiwan and Vietnam for example, we will ask: how should we perceive the subjectivity of women who marry abroad through brokers? How could we challenge the assumption that the brokerage business in transnational marriage is part of human trafficking practice, and women involved in this activity are victims? To better address this issue, we may also need to address the question: what is trafficking in women? How are women represented in the global anti-trafficking campaign and how the politics of charity influences the state\u2019s immigration policymaking and women\u2019s transnational mobility? We will approach these issues from a critical perspective in order to challenge given social perception that ignores women's agency at work. Throughout the semester, we will read theoretical and empirical works from many disciplines, including anthropology, sociology, political economy and women's studies. In addition, we will read primary source materials including news reports, online forums and watch documentaries and film clips.\r", "outcome": "", "syllabus": "", "required_readings": "", "recommended_readings": ""}, {"code": "4012", "title": "Gender Development from a Lifespan Perspective", "career": "Undergraduate", "units": "3.00", "grading": "Graded", "components": "LectureInteractive Tutorial", "campus": "Main Campus", "academic_group": "Gender Studies Pgm Comm", "requirements": "Pre-requisite(s): GDRS1001, GDRS1002, GDRS2010, GDRS2011, UGEC1209.;Not for students who have taken PSYC3640.", "description": "Humans all over the world are inevitably gendered, either voluntarily or involuntarily, in tangible behavior and in perception, from birth to death. Indeed, it is difficult to identify an aspect of human existence, be it ability, health, preferences, beliefs or opportunities, that does not have some flavor of gender. These gender phenomena do not arise from nowhere in adulthood but can be traced from childhood following a complex interplay of social, cognitive, and biological processes. They manifest in rich forms at various points of development. This course tackles the study of gender from a human developmental perspective, with the aim of understanding how gender phenomena arise, develop and change from infancy to older age, how they can be described and how to explain them with an eclectic theoretical approach that balances various developmental forces. The course also emphasizes an understanding of the methodology in empirical studies of age-related changes and causes and consequences of behaviours. Students are expected to engage actively in the identification and analysis of the relevant issues in real life, both of others and their own. At the end of the course, students will gain a critical understand of the role of gender in shaping human development, gain insight into what has led them to become who they are, and be more informed about how to deal with gender phenomena constructively at various life stages.", "outcome": "After completion of this course, students are expected to:\u00a01.

As a discipline, gender studies draws on a variety of knowledge in humanities and social science and shapes its methodology and methods to challenge existing hegemonic knowledge that is considered being produced scientifically. The purpose of this course is to acquaint students with the intellectual debate between feminist epistemology and scientific knowledge production as well as to equip them with the abilities of critical thinking about their methodologies and conducting research with proper methods. Topics include: 1) critical questioning of the validity of knowledge production, the power relations between the researcher and his or her research subjects, and the representation of the research and the researcher; 2) cautiously examining the influence of globalization on feminist research and the intersectionality among race, class and gender; and 3) innovatively connecting theory with praxis through participatory action and writing. We will begin with a brief introduction to the history and development of feminist research, followed by discussions on feminist methodologies by exemplary researchers. In the final weeks, we will shift our focus to the application of theory and groundbreaking feminist writing through collaboration. To make sure students are capable of conducting their own research using a feminist framework, this course also requests students to conduct a mini study and engage in narrative analyses. After taking this course, students are expected to be familiar with feminist approaches of conducting research and able to reflect on the knowledge production of their own research in the future.", "outcome": "Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:\r\u00a01.

Why does gender matter in shaping the experience of work? Beginning with these questions, this course explores the distinct positions of men and women in the workplace and in the labor markets and examines gender relationship, gender segregation and gender discrimination across a variety of research topics on farm work, factory work, migrant work, business, housework, service work, entertainment and leisure. We will be reading about, analyzing, and discussing diverse empirical studies on men and women as workers, homemakers, care workers, organizers, or entrepreneurs, which provide fresh ways to look at the relationship between gender and work. This course provides students with key concepts and theories about the gendered institutions of economic development, organization, migration, and culture. Based on lectures, class discussions, and analytical practices, this course will help students to be an independent thinker and educated reader of social issues from a gender perspective. Students are expected to acquire critical thinking and analytical skills to reflect on theories and research findings, and to evaluate social facts and trends with implications for education, policy interventions and public participation. \r", "outcome": "1.

Students will be introduced to a variety of issues related to work in general - what it means to work, what issues individuals face in finding and keeping jobs, and why people do or do not succeed in the workplace;\u00a04.

We will begin with a brief introduction to the history and development of feminist research, followed by discussions on feminist methodologies by exemplary researchers. In the final weeks, we will shift our focus to the application of theory and groundbreaking feminist writing through collaboration.", "outcome": "1.
