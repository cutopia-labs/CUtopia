The concept of Healthy Setting is to cultivate a healthy physical/psycho-social environment in the setting where people spend most of the time for working, studying, enjoyment of life, or for specific purposes. It is a very effective \u201cintentional intervention\u201d in achieving improvements in both health and well-being of citizens as it would penetrate into the wide arrays of their daily experiences.
