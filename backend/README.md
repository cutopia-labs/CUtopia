# CUtopia Backend

## Packages

Install [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) and [MongoDB Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/compass) to manage the database.

## Deployment

### Create MongoDB Atlas instance

Create a [serverless MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/pricing) instance in Singapore region on AWS. Then, create an admin account and add a whitelisted IP address 0.0.0.0/0 in [MongoDB Cloud](https://cloud.mongodb.com/). Next, obtain your connection URI in MongoDB Cloud.

### Configure AWS CLI

Then run the script below, paste the generated key and set the "Default region name" to "ap-southeast-1", which is Singapore.

```bash
aws configure
```

### Deploy to AWS

All serverless serivces will be deployed to [Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) using the script below. The status of deployed stacks can be found in [CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/).

```bash
# Deploy development stack
export NODE_ENV=development; bash tools/deploy.sh cutopia-dev

# Deploy production stack
export NODE_ENV=production; bash tools/deploy.sh cutopia-production
```

> Note: when running the script for the first time, a few config options will be asked in console. Follow the default values for all options.
